## Let's go through each strategy with examples:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Instead of using a full-fledged Linux distribution like Ubuntu, you can use Alpine Linux, which is much smaller in size. Here's an example Dockerfile using Alpine Linux:

	```Dockerfile
	# Optimized Dockerfile using Alpine Linux
	FROM alpine:latest

	# Install nginx
	RUN apk --no-cache add nginx

	# Expose port 80
	EXPOSE 80

	# Start nginx
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	```

2. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Suppose you're building a Node.js application. You can use multi-stage builds to compile your application and then copy only the necessary artifacts to the final image. Here's an example Dockerfile:

	```Dockerfile
	# Build Stage
	FROM node:14 AS build
	WORKDIR /app

	# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
	COPY package*.json ./

	# Install dependencies
	RUN npm install

	# Copy the rest of the application code
	COPY . .

	# Build the application
	RUN npm run build

	# Production Stage
	FROM nginx:alpine

	# Copy the build artifacts from the build stage
	COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

	# Expose port 80
	EXPOSE 80

	# Start nginx
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	```

3. **Optimize Dockerfile Instructions**: Combine multiple `RUN` commands into a single one to reduce the number of layers. For example:

    ```Dockerfile
	# Optimized Dockerfile using Alpine Linux
	FROM alpine:latest

	# Combine multiple RUN commands to reduce layers
	RUN apk --no-cache update && apk --no-cache add nginx

	# Expose port 80
	EXPOSE 80

	# Start nginx
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    ```

4. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only install necessary dependencies in your container. For example, if your application only needs Python and Flask, your Dockerfile might look like this:

    ```Dockerfile
	# Optimized Dockerfile using Python and Flask
	FROM python:3.9-alpine

	# Install only necessary dependencies in a single RUN command
	RUN pip install Flask

	# Copy application code
	COPY . /app

	# Set the working directory
	WORKDIR /app

	# Run the application
	CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

5. **Cache Dependencies**: Place frequently changing instructions towards the bottom of the Dockerfile to leverage caching. For example, copy the application code as late as possible:

    ```Dockerfile
	# Cache Layer Version
	FROM node:14 AS build

	# Set the working directory
	WORKDIR /app

	# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
	COPY package*.json ./

	# Install dependencies (cached)
	RUN npm install

	# Copy the rest of the application code
	COPY . .

	# Building the application
	RUN npm run build
    ```

6. **Compress Artifacts**: Before copying files into the container, compress them to reduce size. For example, if you have large static files:

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```

7. **Use .dockerignore**: Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories. For example, exclude node_modules directory for a Node.js application:

    ```
    node_modules
    .git
    ```

8. **Remove Unused Layers**: After building your image, remove any unnecessary layers. You can use tools like Docker Squash to squash layers together:

    ```bash
    docker-squash -t new-image old-image
    ```

9. **Optimize Runtime Configuration**: Configure your application to use resources efficiently at runtime. For example, set appropriate memory limits in your Docker Compose file:

    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        image: nginx:alpine
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 512M
    ```

10. **Regularly Update Base Images**: Ensure you regularly update your base images and dependencies to incorporate security patches. You can use tools like Docker Security Scanning to identify vulnerabilities in your images.

We can combine these technique together to build optimized docker images. With Multi-Stage Builds and Combined `RUN` Commands:

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json, install dependencies, and build the application in a single RUN command
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application in a single RUN command
RUN npm run build

# Production Stage
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build artifacts from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
